            <h1>Barbecue in the United States</h1>
            <p> In the United States, barbecue refers to a technique of cooking meat outdoors <br> 
                over a fire; often this is called pit barbecue, and the facility for cooking it is the <br>
                barbecue pit. This form of cooking adds a distinctive smoky taste to the meat; <br>
                barbecue sauce, while a common accompaniment, is not required for many styles.
                <br>
                In the South, barbecue is more than just a style of cooking, but a subculture <br> 
                with wide variation between regions, and fierce rivalry for titles at barbecue <br>
                competitions. Often the proprietors of Southern-style barbecue establishments <br>
                in other areas originate from the South.

            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>There are usually three ingredients to barbecue—meat and wood smoke are <br>
                essential. The use of a sauce or seasoning varies widely between regional <br>
                traditions. The first ingredient in the barbecue tradition is the meat. The most <br>
                widely used meat in most barbecue is pork, particularly pork ribs, and also the <br>
                pork shoulder for pulled pork. (In Texas, beef is more common, especially brisket.)
                <br>
                The techniques used to cook the meat are hot smoking and smoke cooking,<br>
                distinct from cold-smoking. Hot smoking is when meat is cooked with a wood <br>
                fire, over indirect heat, at temperatures 50-80 °C, and smoke cooking (the method <br>
                used in barbecue) is cooking over indirect fire at higher temperatures, often in the <br>
                range of 121°C ±28°C. The long, slow cooking process can take up to 18 hours,<br>
                and leaves the meat tender and juicy. Characteristically, this process leaves a <br>
                distinctive line of red just under the surface, where the myoglobin in the meat <br>
                reacts with carbon monoxide from the smoke, and imparts the smoky taste <br>
                essential too barbecue.
                <br>
                The second ingredient in barbecue is the wood used to smoke the meat. <br>
                Since the wood smoke flavors the food, the type of wood used influences the process. <br>
                Different woods impart different flavors, so the regional availability of various <br>
                woods for smoking defines the taste of the region's barbecue.
                <br>
                    <br> • Hard woods such as hickory, mesquite and various varieties of oak impart           
                        a strong smoke flavor.
                    <br> • Maple, alder, pecan and fruit woods such as apple, pear, and cherry impart                                      
                        a milder, sweeter taste. <br>
                <br>
                Stronger flavored woods are used for pork and beef, while the lighter flavored <br>
                woods are used for fish and poultry. More exotic smoke-generating ingredients <br>
                can be found in some recipes; grapevine adds a sweet flavor, and sassafras, a <br>
                major flavour in root beer, adds its distinctive taste to the smoke.
                
                The last, and in many cases optional, ingredient is the barbecue sauce. There <br>
                are no constants, with sauces running the gamut from clear, peppered vinegars <br>
                to thick, sweet, tomato and molasses sauces to mustard-based barbecue <br>
                sauces, which themselves range from mild to painfully spicy. The sauce may be <br>
                used as a marinade before cooking, applied during cooking, after cooking, or <br>
                used as a table sauce. An alternate to barbecue sauce is dry rub, a mixture of <br>
                salt and spices applied to the meat before cooking.

            <h1>Barbecue tradition</h1>
            <p> Barbecue has been a staple of American culture, especially Southern American <br>
                culture, since colonial times. As it emerged over years many traditions have <br>
                become prevalent in the United States. Barbecue remains one of the most <br>
                traditional foods in the United States. While many festive foods, such as roasted <br>
                turkey or ham, are usually served on particular days or holidays, barbecue can <br>
                be served on any day. Barbecue is often served on the 4. of July; however, it is <br>
                not only confined to that day. Barbecues tend to bring people together and <br>
                serve as a bonding experience at any time of the year. It brings people back to <br>
                their roots, providing a cooking experience that is often an escape from <br>
                civilisation and closer to nature. Barbecues are traditionally held outside. They <br>
                could be small informal gatherings with a few people in a backyard or a formal <br>
                event that could last all day, typically held for larger numbers of people. <br>
                Barbecue has been a tradition in the United States beginning with Native <br>
                Americans. By the 19th century, barbecues became one of the main forms of <br>
                United States public celebration, especially in celebration of 4 July.
                <br>
                As barbecues continued to be held through the times of U.S. expansion the <br>
                traditions began to migrate with the people. Today, barbecues held in different <br>
                regions of the country vary in cuisine but the cuisines all hold the same concept <br>
                of cooking outside and over a fire. Barbecues today have taken on new <br>
                meaning yet again with the emergence of competitive barbecue. Competitive <br>
                barbecue competitions are held throughout the country in which people will <br>
                compete by cooking barbecue and having it judged by the events judges. The <br>
                constraints of what one may barbecue and the qualities that are judged vary by <br>
                competition. Usually, competitions are held in big open areas where spectators <br>
                will be admitted as well and barbecue is served to all.
                <br>
                The pig, the essential ingredient to most barbecue, became a fundamental part <br>
                of Southern cuisine in the 18th century because it requires little maintenance <br>
                and more efficiently converts feed to meat (six times quicker than beef cattle). As a <br>
                result of the prevalence of hogs in the South, the pig became synonymous with <br>
                Southern culture and barbecue.The pig symbolising Southern culture began as <br>
                a result of its value as an economic commodity. By 1860, hogs and southern <br>
                livestock were valued at double the cotton crop, at a price of half a billion <br>
                dollars. The majority of pigs were raised by residents of the South and pigs <br>
                contributed considerably to the economic well-being of many Southerners. <br>
                Pigs and barbecue were not only valuable economically but for barbecues <br>
                “scores of hog” were set aside for large gatherings, often used for political <br>
                rallies, church events, and harvest festival celebrations.
                <br>
                Barbecues have been a part of American history and tradition as early as the <br>
                first Independence Day celebration. In the early years, Independence Day was <br>
                celebrated as a formal gathering, in which civic ideals were reinforced. The <br>
                traditions of Independence Day moved across the country as settlers traveled to <br>
                western territories. By the 19th century, the role of barbecue in public <br>
                celebration and political events increased significantly, becoming prominent <br>
                in the South and the Midwest.

    <h2>The four MAIN regional styles</h2>
    <div>
        <h1>Carolina</h1>
        <p> Throughout the Carolinas, barbecue is exclusively defined as being pork. <br>
            Pork can be either prepared as the whole animal (Whole Hog) or prepared by <br>
            the individual cut, typically the shoulder. Meat is served pulled, shredded, <br>
            chopped, and occasionally sliced. It is cooked with hardwood and/or <br>
            hardwood charcoal.<br>
            It is served with a vinegar-based sauce for dipping.
            <br>
            Sauces used to 'mop' meat while cooking vary dramatically from Western <br>
            North Carolina through the East and South Carolina. Although mustard <br>
            is commonly associated with South Carolina barbecue, its application  <br>
            in barbecue cooking can be seen throughout the United States wherever <br>
            German immigrants settled. Use of mustard or tomato varies drastically <br>
            throughout the Carolinas, although mustard based is more common in South <br>
            Carolina and eastern North Carolina, and vinegar and ketchup based <br>
            (Lexington style) is more common in central and western North Carolina. <br>
            Carolina hog-based barbecue is considered the major starting point for the <br>
            American barbecue diaspora.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Texas</h1>
        <p> There are four generally recognized 
            regional styles of barbecue in Texas:
            <br>
            East Texas style <br>
            Essentially Southern barbecue, found in many urban areas
            <br>
            Central Texas “meat market style” <br>
            Which originated in the butcher shops of German and Czech immigrants to the region
            <br>
            West Texas “cowboy style” <br>
            Involving direct cooking over mesquite and using goat and mutton as well as beef
            <br>
            South Texas barbacoa <br>
            In which the head of a cow is cooked (originally underground)
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Kansas City</h1>
        <p> Barbecue was brought to Kansas City, Missouri by Memphian Henry Perry. <br>
            Despite these origins, the Kansas City style is characterized by a wide variety <br>
            in meat, including beef, pork, and lamb; a strong emphasis on the sauce; and <br>
            by including French fries as a side dish.
            <br>
            Kansas City barbecue is rubbed with spices, slow-smoked over a variety of <br>
            woods and served with a thick tomato-based barbecue sauce, which is an <br>
            integral part of KC-style barbecue.
            <br>
            Major Kansas City-area barbecue restaurants include Arthur Bryant's, which is <br>
            descended directly from Perry's establishment and Gates Bar-B-Q, notably <br>
            spicier than other KC-style sauces with primary seasonings being cumin and <br>
            celery salt.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Memphis</h1>
        <p> Memphis barbecue is primarily two different dishes: ribs, which come <br>
            “wet” or “dry”, and barbecue sandwiches.<br>
            Wet ribs are brushed with sauce before and after cooking,<br>
            and dry ribs are seasoned with a dry rub. <br>
            Barbecue sandwiches in Memphis are typically pulled pork <br>
             (that is shredded by hand and not chopped with a blade) <br>
            served on a simple bun and topped with barbecue sauce, and coleslaw. <br>
            <br>
            Of note is the willingness of Memphians to put this pulled pork on many <br>
            non-traditional dishes, creating such dishes as barbecue salad, barbecue <br>
            spaghetti, barbecue pizza, or barbecue nachos.
